# Session Log: 2026-02-25 16:00

## Project: llm-council

> Also logged: [Task Management] — `../../log/2026-02-25-1600.md`
> Also logged: [Topic Finder] — path below

## What We Did
- Extracted generic council orchestration from topic-finder into standalone `llm-council` Python package
- Package structure: `src/llm_council/` with `client.py` (LLMClient), `council.py` (CouncilService), `config.py` (model registry), `models.py` (Pydantic models), `cli.py` (CLI entry point)
- Fixed `stage3_fallback` tracking — `_stage3_synthesise()` returns `tuple[dict, bool]` so `CouncilMeta` correctly flags degraded synthesis
- Created GitHub repo `flonat/llm-council` (public) and pushed
- Git-initialised with first commit + fix commit

## Key Decisions
- Package lives in `packages/llm-council/` inside Task Management (shared library, not an application)
- Uses OpenRouter (OpenAI-compatible API) for multi-provider LLM access — real model diversity, not Claude sub-agents
- CLI via `python -m llm_council` for standalone use; library API for integration

## Files Changed
- `src/llm_council/client.py` — LLMClient with JSON/text modes, retry logic, error handling
- `src/llm_council/council.py` — 3-stage CouncilService (assess → peer review → synthesis)
- `src/llm_council/config.py` — Model registry, pricing, provider management
- `src/llm_council/models.py` — CouncilResult, CouncilAssessment, CouncilPeerReview, CouncilMeta
- `src/llm_council/cli.py` — CLI entry point
- `pyproject.toml` — Package metadata and dependencies
